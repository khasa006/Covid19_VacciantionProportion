## Introduction
The goal of this project was to use the skills learned in Advanced R programming class to wrangle, clean, and extract information from the CDC's open data repository related to the Delta variant of COVID-19 Vaccination Proportion trend for three Florida counties: Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward.


## Our Processs
In order to replicate our work, here are the following steps:

1. Go to <https://healthdata.gov/Health/COVID-19-Community-Profile-Report/gqxm-d9w9> and download the `.xlsx` files for the dates of interest. We check for new data files daily. 
2. Save the selected data files to `data_CDC_raw/` (do not change the file names; they should all be in the form "Community_Profile_Report_[YYYYMMDD]_Public.xlsx").
3. Run the files to create the plot.
